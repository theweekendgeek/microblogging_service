# Microblogging Service

Repository: [https://git.doescher.ninja/theweekendgeek/microblogging_service](https://git.doescher.ninja/theweekendgeek/microblogging_service)

## Description
Initially developed to save post from Twitter to a database with the goal to the containing links in a custom, newsreader like frontend.
Stopped active development after a thin skinned, hypocritical billionaire purchased the site.

Mid-term I'd like to refactor it to work with Mastodon (and eventually other sites) and finish my initial goal.
